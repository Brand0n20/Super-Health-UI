# Super Health Inc.

This is a starter project for Super Health Inc. that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This application serves as a service for a hospital/clinic where it is supposed to keep track of its patients and their encounters/visits with our doctors. The application allows for the user to edit, add, and delete a patient. Although, a patient may only be deleted if they had no encounters linked to them. You can also add and edit encounters once you're in a specific patient's details page.
